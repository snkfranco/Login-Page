# Login Page - Example

This is an example of a login page that can be easily created using HTML5 and CSS, featuring a minimalist interface for easy understanding and simple code.

The page has been coded to be responsive to various types of devices, ensuring that the animated image adjusts accordingly and gives preference to the login form (card).

Feel free to edit it and do as you please. The intention will always be to contribute in some way with you all. If you have any suggestions, just open a fork and make your modifications! Thank you!
